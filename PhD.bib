abstract = {Presents an approach to movement planning, on-line trajectory
modification, and imitation learning by representing movement plans
based on a set of nonlinear differential equations with well-defined
attractor dynamics. The resultant movement plan remains an autonomous
set of nonlinear differential equations that forms a control policy (CP)
which is robust to strong external perturbations and that can be
modified on-line by additional perceptual variables. We evaluate the
system with a humanoid robot simulation and an actual humanoid robot.
Experiments are presented for the imitation of three types of movements:
reaching movements with one arm, drawing movements of 2-D patterns, and
tennis swings. Our results demonstrate (a) that multi-joint human
movements can be encoded successfully by the CPs, (b) that a learned
movement policy can readily be reused to produce robust trajectories
towards different targets, (c) that a policy fitted for one particular
target provides a good predictor of human reaching movements towards
neighboring targets, and (d) that the parameter space which encodes a
policy is suitable for measuring to which extent two trajectories are
qualitatively similar},

abstract = {Policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithms are amongst the most popular algorithms in the reinforcement learning framework. Their advantage of being able to search for optimal policies using low-variance gradient estimates has made them useful in several real-life applications, such as robotics, power control, and finance. Although general surveys on reinforcement learning techniques already exist, no survey is specifically dedicated to actor-critic algorithms in particular. This paper, therefore, describes the state of the art of actor-critic algorithms, with a focus on methods that can work in an online setting and use function approximation in order to deal with continuous state and action spaces. After starting with a discussion on the concepts of reinforcement learning and the origins of actor-critic algorithms, this paper describes the workings of the natural gradient, which has made its way into many actor-critic algorithms over the past few years. A review of several standard and natural actor-critic algorithms is given, and the paper concludes with an overview of application areas and a discussion on open issues.},

abstract = {Exploratory activities seem to be intrinsically rewarding for children and crucial for their cognitive development. Can a machine be endowed with such an intrinsic motivation system? This is the question we study in this paper, presenting a number of computational systems that try to capture this drive towards novel or curious situations. After discussing related research coming from developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental robotics, and active learning, this paper presents the mechanism of Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity, an intrinsic motivation system which pushes a robot towards situations in which it maximizes its learning progress. This drive makes the robot focus on situations which are neither too predictable nor too unpredictable, thus permitting autonomous mental development. The complexity of the robot's activities autonomously increases and complex developmental sequences self-organize without being constructed in a supervised manner. Two experiments are presented illustrating the stage-like organization emerging with this mechanism. In one of them, a physical robot is placed on a baby play mat with objects that it can learn to manipulate. Experimental results show that the robot first spends time in situations which are easy to learn, then shifts its attention progressively to situations of increasing difficulty, avoiding situations in which nothing can be learned. Finally, these various results are discussed in relation to more complex forms of behavioral organization and data coming from developmental psychology},

With zero knowledge built in at the start of learning (i.e., given only a raw description of the board state), the network learns to play at a strong intermediate level. Furthermore, when a set of hand-crafted features is added to the network's input representation, the result is a truly staggering level of performance: the latest version of TD-Gammon is now estimated to play at a strong master level that is extremely close to the world's best human players.},

@article{Fremaux2013,
abstract = {Animals repeat rewarded behaviors, but the physiological basis of reward-based learning has only been partially elucidated. On one hand, experimental evidence shows that the neuromodulator dopamine carries information about rewards and affects synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, the theory of reinforcement learning provides a framework for reward-based learning. Recent models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity have made first steps towards bridging the gap between the two approaches, but faced two problems. First, reinforcement learning is typically formulated in a discrete framework, ill-adapted to the description of natural situations. Second, biologically plausible models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity require precise calculation of the reward prediction error, yet it remains to be shown how this can be computed by neurons. Here we propose a solution to these problems by extending the continuous temporal difference (TD) learning of Doya (2000) to the case of spiking neurons in an actor-critic network operating in continuous time, and with continuous state and action representations. In our model, the critic learns to predict expected future rewards in real time. Its activity, together with actual rewards, conditions the delivery of a neuromodulatory TD signal to itself and to the actor, which is responsible for action choice. In simulations, we show that such an architecture can solve a Morris water-maze-like navigation task, in a number of trials consistent with reported animal performance. We also use our model to solve the acrobot and the cartpole problems, two complex motor control tasks. Our model provides a plausible way of computing reward prediction error in the brain. Moreover, the analytically derived learning rule is consistent with experimental evidence for dopamine-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity.},

An increasingly common approach therefore is to evolve an agent's morphology along with its control in the hope that evolution will find a good coupled system. In order for embodied artificial intelligence to gain credibility within the robotics and cognitive science communities, however, it is necessary to amass evidence not only for how to co-optimize morphology and control of adaptive machines, but why. This work provides two new lines of evidence for why this co-optimization is useful: Here we show that for an object manipulation task in which a simulated robot must accomplish one, two, or three objectives simultaneously, subjugating more aspects of the robot's morphology to selective pressure allows for the evolution of better robots as the number of objectives increases. In addition, for robots that successfully evolved to accomplish all of their objectives, those composed of evolved rather than fixed morphologies generalized better to previously unseen environmental conditions.},

The actor updates are achieved using stochastic policy gradients employing Amari's natural gradient approach, while the critic obtains both the natural policy gradient and additional parameters of a value function simultaneously by linear regression. We show that actor improvements with natural policy gradients are particularly appealing as these are independent of coordinate frame of the chosen policy representation, and can be estimated more efficiently than regular policy gradients. The critic makes use of a special basis function parameterization motivated by the policy-gradient compatible function approximation. We show that several well-known reinforcement learning methods such as the original Actor-Critic and Bradtke's Linear Quadratic Q-Learning are in fact Natural Actor-Critic algorithms. Empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques in comparison to previous methods, and also demonstrate their applicability for learning control on an anthropomorphic robot arm. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the past, computational motor control has been approached from at least two major frameworks: the dynamic systems approach and the viewpoint of optimal control. The dynamic system approach emphasizes motor control as a process of self-organization between an animal and its environment. Nonlinear differential equations that can model entrainment and synchronization behavior are among the most favorable tools of dynamic systems modelers. In contrast, optimal control approaches view motor control as the evolutionary or development result of a nervous system that tries to optimize rather general organizational principles, e.g., energy consumption or accurate task achievement. Optimal control theory is usually employed to develop appropriate theories. Interestingly, there is rather little interaction between dynamic systems and optimal control modelers as the two approaches follow rather different philosophies and are often viewed as diametrically opposing. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to motor control that offers a unifying modeling framework for both dynamic systems and optimal control approaches. In discussions of several behavioral experiments and some theoretical and robotics studies, we demonstrate how our computational ideas allow both the representation of self-organizing processes and the optimization of movement based on reward criteria. Our modeling framework is rather simple and general, and opens opportunities to revisit many previous modeling results from this novel unifying view.},

abstract = {Quite some research has been done on reinforcement learning in continuous environments, but the research on problems where the actions can also be chosen from a continuous space is much more limited. We present a new class of algorithms named continuous actor critic learning automaton (CACLA) that can handle continuous states and actions. The resulting algorithm is straightforward to implement. An experimental comparison is made between this algorithm and other algorithms that can handle continuous action spaces. These experiments show that CACLA performs much better than the other algorithms, especially when it is combined with a Gaussian exploration method},

abstract = {This paper introduces NFQ, an algorithm for efficient and ef- fective training of a Q-value function represented by amulti-layer percep- tron. Based on the principle of storing and reusing transition experiences, a model-free, neural network based Reinforcement Learning algorithm is proposed. The method is evaluated on three benchmark problems. It is shown empirically, that reasonably few interactions with the plant are needed to generate control policies of high quality.},

@article{Kober2010a,
abstract = {The acquisition and self-improvement of novel motor skills is among the most important problems in robotics. Motor primitives offer one of the most promising frameworks for the application of machine learning techniques in this context. Employing an improved form of the dynamic systems motor primitives originally introduced by Ijspeert et al. [2], we show how both discrete and rhythmic tasks can be learned using a concerted approach of both imitation and reinforcement learning. For doing so, we present both learning algorithms and representations targeted for the practical application in robotics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to include a start-up phase in rhythmic primitives. We show that two new motor skills, i.e., Ball-in-a-Cup and Ball-Paddling, can be learned on a real Barrett WAM robot arm at a pace similar to human learning while achieving a significantly more reliable final performance.},

@article{Lin1992,
abstract = {To date, reinforcement learning has mostly been studied solving simple learning tasks. Reinforcement learning methods that have been studied so far typically converge slowly. The purpose of this work is thus two-fold: 1) to investigate the utility of reinforcement learning in solving much more complicated learning tasks than previously studied, and 2) to investigate methods that will speed up reinforcement learning.},

@article{Konda2003,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms. These ar two-time-scale algorithms in which the critic uses temporal difference (TD) learning with a linearly parameterized approximation architecture, and the actor is updated in an approximate gradient direction based on information provided by the critic. We show that the features for the critic should ideally span a subspace prescribed by the choice of parameterization of the actor. We study actorcritic algorithms for Markov decision processes with general state and action spaces. We state and prove two results regarding their convergence.},
