\begin{itemize}
 \item data efficiency : importance sampling
 \item non linearity
 \item continuous
\end{itemize}

without model without prior trajectories.



The non linearity is sought to be able to automatically extract representations
without any domain knowledge. Thus the learned model have less restrictions,
it is not necessary to design properly some basis functions.

This is a first step towards deep reinforcement learning with continuous action space.

Firstly, the existing algorithms and theirs limitations are described, 
an experimental comparison.
